                    <p>
                        A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely
                        linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the
                        previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where
                        data nodes are represented by leaves).

                    <h2>Everything About Truffle </h2>
                    <p>
                        Truffle is a popular development framework for building decentralized applications (dapps) on
                        the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a suite of tools for developing and testing dapps, as well
                        as deploying them to the Ethereum network.

                    <h2>Everything about Ethereum </h2>
                    <p>
                        Ethereum is a technology for building apps and organizations, holding assets, transacting and
                        communicating without being controlled by a central authority. There is no need to hand over all
                        your personal details to use Ethereum - you keep control of your own data and what is being
                        shared. Ethereum has its own cryptocurrency, Ether, which is used to pay for certain activities
                        on the Ethereum network.
